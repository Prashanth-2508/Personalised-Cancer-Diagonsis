# Personalised-Cancer-Diagonsis
Predict the probability of each data-point belonging to each of the nine classes.
Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

## Type of machine learning problem
There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified into => Multi class classification problem

## Performance metrics
Multi class log-loss
Confusion matrix

## Constraints
1. Interpretability
2. Class probabilities are needed.
3. Penalize the errors in class probabilites => Metric is Log-loss.
4. No Latency constraints.
